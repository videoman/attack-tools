# Useful sciprts for doing testing

## ports.py
Got a ton of nmap files, and want to make a list of hosts that have open ports? This script will create a directory with port.portname that has all the ip addresses that are assoicated with that port. Usefull for medusa, crackmapexec, and for loops to wget, etc.
